src/keyword.c: (in function createNode)
src/keyword.c:115:12: Parameter 1 (newNode->key) to function strcpy is declared
    unique but may be aliased externally by parameter 2 (token)
  A unique or only parameter may be aliased by some other parameter or visible
  global. (Use -mayaliasunique to inhibit warning)
src/keyword.c: (in function keywordSearch)
src/keyword.c:164:9: Implicitly only storage last->next (type struct keyword *)
    not released before assignment: last->next = createNode(p1, token)
  A memory leak has been detected. Only-qualified storage is not released
  before the last reference to it is lost. (Use -mustfreeonly to inhibit
  warning)
src/keyword.c: (in function cleanFunc)
src/keyword.c:173:9: Only storage keywordll->next assigned to unqualified:
                        keywordll = keywordll->next
  The only reference to this storage is transferred to another reference (e.g.,
  by returning it) that does not have the only annotation. This may lead to a
  memory leak, since the new reference is not necessarily released. (Use
  -onlytrans to inhibit warning)
src/keyword.c:175:14: Only storage temp1->next (type struct keyword *) derived
    from released storage is not released (memory leak): temp1
  A storage leak due to incomplete deallocation of a structure or deep pointer
  is suspected. Unshared storage that is reachable from a reference that is
  being deallocated has not yet been deallocated. Splint assumes when an object
  is passed as an out only void pointer that the outer object will be
  deallocated, but the inner objects will not. (Use -compdestroy to inhibit
  warning)
