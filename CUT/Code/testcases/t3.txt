Abstract- We construct some standard orthogonal L-fuzzy fixed-point findings for almost orthogonal Î˜-contraction in the context of orthogonal complete ms using the orthogonal L-fuzzy mapping (OLF-mapping). We prove some non-trivial examples to supporting our main results. Also, we establish a theoretical computer science application to domain of words.
